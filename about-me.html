                        <li> <em> Blog-like </em> posting if I learned or experienced something interesting recently

                Feel free to bookmark this page. 
                This website possesses a cool tool: 
                you can add your email and whenever I feel that I have made a significant update, I can notify all of you. 
                You can bet that the notifications themselves will be terse and occasional ;)
            </p>
            <p> My intention is to introduce you all to something, even if it ends up being just one thing, that you could positively incorporate into your own life :) </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, I will try to keep the vibe of this website fun and laid back. 
                Enjoy!
            </p>
